# HDocument

The purpose of this library is to provide DOM HTML management 
similar to System.Linq.Xml.XDocument. 

Eventually, will add some methods such as jQuery DOM manipulation and selectors.

This project is because I need some features for a private project. 
HtmlAgilityPack coupled with Fizzler don't bring me fully that I need.

As such, this project brings not much, if you need more I recommend you to use 
[HtmlAgilityPack](https://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) and 
[Fizzler](http://code.google.com/p/fizzler/).
